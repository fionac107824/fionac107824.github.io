    <h2>Claim</h2>
    <p>The mystery black box has a container that overfills and connects to a tube that dispenses the water on the outside. A key structure within our diagram was having tubes connected to the side of two cups (these acted as storage for the added water) and having it be a certain height so the water was only dispensed when there was enough water in the cup. This function may be one in the actual mystery black box because it provides reasoning for why the black box retained water and did not dispense any water when we first added 500ml. </p>

    <h2>Evidence</h2>
    <p>The mystery black box is a box that has some kind of unknown mechanism inside that dispenses water when added. The black mystery box has a funnel from the top of the box and a tube that acts as a dispenser at the front of the box. When we first tested out the mystery black box, we added about 500ml of water but nothing came out. Then we added another 500ml more water inside of the black box and 110ml of water was dispensed. There seemed to be a common theme as we added in 500ml there was always less water than the water originally added. But, there was an outlier where we added 500ml of water, and more water (1915ml) came out. By then, our group knew that our model had to have some sort of function that allows it to retain some water but also be overfilled when a certain amount of water retention was reached. Our first sketch had the idea of using a rubber band to tie a cup onto it that would fall down when too much water was added. However, we figured out that this would cause the black box to make a sound when the cup turned over from the rubber band but when we tested this hypothesis the mystery black box did not make a sound. So, we revised and created a diagram of having one cup (cup 1) on top connected to the funnel and then having a tube from the side of cup 1 to the top of cup 2 connected to the bottom. Cup 2 would then have another tube that was connected to the cup on the side and this tube would become the dispenser. The main focus of our box was to replicate the effect of retaining water and then leaking when too much water was added. We had to revise multiple times and replace cup 1 because the end started leaking. When we finally were able to test out our model we added 300ml of water but 0ml came out. We repeated adding 300ml and got 0ml dispensed for trials 1-3. We were able to mimic the mystery black box not dispensing water despite having water added which indicated that. We then added 400ml and got 400ml of water dispensed. With our later trials, we continued adding around 380ml or 400ml but got less water dispensed, just like the mystery black box. In some aspects, we were able to create our model to be similar to the mystery black box with the functions of not dispensing water at first and then having smaller amounts of water dispensed than the amount of water added.</p>

    <h2>Reasoning I</h2>
    <p> Models are smaller copies of something that are used to represent something. It could be useful to discover something unknown or test out a new theory. The general strength of a model is that it allows you to test out a theory and find improvements without experimenting on the original copy. The limitation of models is that they are not representative of the actual dimensions so they do not fully match the actual mystery black box. Models are much less complex than the actual thing they are replicating because sometimes the components of the original model are larger than needed for a model. </p>

    <h2>Reasoning II</h2>
    <p>Our model replicates the mystery black box’s ability to retain water and release less water than input. Our claim is supported by how the mystery black box at first when we put in 500ml of water the mystery black box dispensed no water. Our model had the same effect as when we added 400 ml of water and no water came out. This is convincing as our model was able to have a function or outlier of the mystery black box when it did not dispense all of the water added in. Furthermore, our data also seems to have similar patterns as the data for the original mystery black box did. For instance, we added in 400ml and then 380 ml was dispensed. Then we added 400 more ml and 320ml of water was dispensed. This directly correlates with the mystery black box’s data of having less water come out than inputted as when we added in 500 ml of water, 440 ml was dispensed in trial 7. </p>

    <h2>Reasoning III</h2>
    <p>The mystery black box does not have a container that overfills. If the mystery black box did not have a container that overfilled, then the mystery black box would not be able to retain water (when we added in 500 ml of water nothing came out) or have less water dispensed than added (when we added in 500ml of water and 450ml was dispensed). While our model did not depict the whole mechanisms within the mystery black box, we were able to replicate the mystery black box’s ability to retain water and dispense less water than inputted.</p>
