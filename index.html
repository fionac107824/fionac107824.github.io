    <p>The mystery black box has a container that overfills and connects to a tube that dispenses the water on the outside. A key structure within our diagram was having tubes connected to the side of two cups (these acted as storage for the added water) and having it be a certain height so the water was only dispensed when there was enough water in the cup. This function may be one in the actual mystery black box because it provides reasoning for why the black box retained water and did not dispense any water when we first added 500ml. </p>
